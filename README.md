##Python tools for using random forest classifiers on data pulled from MATLAB

This project is initially designed to take output from [PuffAnalysis](https://github.com/exark/puffsAnalysis) and make it easily manipulable in Python. Presently the project includes two primary pieces:

* mat2py: Converts a .mat file into a collection of ndarrays parseable for downstream python applications
* RandomForests: Tool which takes arbitrary variables as training and testing data for scikit's random forest classifier.
